# Notes App

Notes App is my experiment to write Android app in Kotlin using Clean Architecture and Design Patterns principles. In this project you can find:

  - swipe to delete feature using ItemTouchHelper
  - the delete-undo feature is implemented using the Command pattern
  - used Kotlin coroutines to handle asynchronous work
  - change language at runtime in the options menu (personally I agree with Google that this should be avoided in production apps)

### Installation

Install the dependencies and run the app in Android Studio.
